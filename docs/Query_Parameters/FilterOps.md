**FilterOps**

`filterOp` is used by all NNA queries and the options available to use on your query will depend on what you chose for your `filter`.
Please remember that `filterOp` sits in between your `filter` and your `value` and is just the conditional linking the two.

Example: `&filter=fileSize:eq:0` is a filter looking for empty files (file size equal to 0 bytes).
Yet, `&filter=fileSize:notEq:0` is the opposite filter, looking for all non-empty files.

You can always find the full list of available filterOps by going to `/filterOps` REST endpoint.
