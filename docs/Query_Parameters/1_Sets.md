**Sets:**

`set` is used by all NNA queries and will define the options of `filter`, `type`, and `sum` you will have access to.
NNA will attempt to prevent you from running queries that would not work by pre-emptively failing the query.

You can always find the full list of available sets by going to `/sets` REST endpoint.

1. `files` - Represents the set of all files.
2. `dirs` - Represents the set of all directories.
