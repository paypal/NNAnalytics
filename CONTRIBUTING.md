# Contributing to NNA

## Overview
We believe that contributors are users first.  Familiarize yourself with the application. Provide feedback on improvements to either documentation or the code by opening a [Github Issue](../../issues/new "Github Issue"). For more details on how to contribute, read on.

## How you can help

### Documentation
New users rely on the documentation and on commonly-followed conventions to get up-and-running on an application. If you spot any gaps, please open a [Github Issue](../../issues/new "Github Issue") and raise a pull request.


### Code
Look for existing [open GitHub issues](../../issues "open GitHub issues") or [open your own](../../issues/new "open your own"). Implement a solution and ensure that you [follow our contribution guidelines](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

For example:
- Your changes must not decrease code coverage or diverge from the code style. Additionally, since we plan to generate release notes from the first lines of the commit messages, please follow the [7 Rules of Good Git Commits](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ "7 Rules of Good Git Commits")
